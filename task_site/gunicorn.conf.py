#
#   spew - Install a trace function that spews every line of Python

#       nuclear option.

# Server mechanics
#
#   daemon - Detach the main Gunicorn process from the controlling
#       terminal with a standard fork/fork sequence.
#
#       True or False
#
#   raw_env - Pass environment variables to the execution environment.
#
#   pidfile - The path to a pid file to write
#
#       A path string or None to not write a pid file.
#
#   user - Switch worker processes to run as this user.
#
#       A valid user id (as an integer) or the name of a user that
#       can be retrieved with a call to pwd.getpwnam(value) or None
#       to not change the worker process user.
#
#   group - Switch worker process to run as this group.
#
#       A valid group id (as an integer) or the name of a user that
#       can be retrieved with a call to pwd.getgrnam(value) or None
#       to change the worker processes group.
#
#   umask - A mask for file permissions written by Gunicorn. Note that
#       this affects unix socket permissions.
#
#       A valid value for the os.umask(mode) call or a string
#       compatible with int(value, 0) (0 means Python guesses
#       the base, so values like "0", "0xFF", "0022" are valid
#       for decimal, hex, and octal representations)
#
#   tmp_upload_dir - A directory to store temporary request data when
#       requests are read. This will most likely be disappearing soon.
#
#       A path to a directory where the process owner can write. Or
#       None to signal that Python should choose one on its own.

#   Logging

#
#       A string of "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "critical"

# Process naming
#
#   proc_name - A base to use with setproctitle to change the way
#       that Gunicorn processes are reported in the system process
#       table. This affects things like 'ps' and 'top'. If you're
#       going to be running more than one instance of Gunicorn you'll
#       probably want to set a name to tell them apart. This requires
#       that you install the setproctitle module.
#
#       A string or None to choose a default of something like 'gunicorn'.
